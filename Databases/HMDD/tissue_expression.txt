tissue_expression_up	hsa-mir-21	Pancreatic Neoplasms	21983937	"miRNA-21 was the most significantly overexpressed miRNA in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas analyzed, and was also highly expressed in 75% of the 65 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas examined by real-time RT-PCR. High miRNA-21 expression was correlated with a worse prognosis in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients (P=0.045). The immunohistochemical expression patterns of PDCD4 (reduced nuclear staining pattern) and TIMP3 (downregulated expression) were significantly associated with both the upregulated miR-21 expression (P<0.05) and the poor survival of the patients (P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively). Our data suggest that an overexpression of miRNA-21 is, therefore, associated with the biological behavior of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma via the downregulation of the expression of tumor suppressors, PDCD4 and TIMP3, thus resulting in tumor progression and the adverse clinical course of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."
